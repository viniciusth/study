### Spacing
Space over time studying the same topics, preferably after sleeping at least once but don't go overboard on the time it takes to review and continue learning. Maybe 1-3 days is the best zone of time to give this pause.
### Retrieval
Remember from memory everything that you can about a subject: write it out, speak about it, really bring all that is possible about it. Can be useful for remembering specific concepts or more high level topics. Check if you information is correct after, for information you really want to not forget do this multiple times over different days.
### Interleaving
When studying, try to fit in multiple related subjects at once, for example: 30 min Algorithms, 30 min Math.
### Elaboration
When going over a concept, dive deep on it, try to create problems or questions related to that concept and answer those questions (you can verify correctness later).
### Dual Coding
Associate visual information about concepts, one simple example would be Graph Theory, you have many pure math descriptions but you may as well just draw an example that shows the same concept.
### Concrete Examples
As the name suggests, give concrete examples for concepts, don't leave them fully in theory.
