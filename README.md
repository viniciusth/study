Repository for my personal study notes, expected to be used with obsidian.

Community plugins used are defined in `.obsidian/community-plugins.json` 

#### Current decisions
- File hierarchy is based on where the content came from, or what the content is related to, with some top level categories to make the top level cleaner
- Inside a "knowledge/content source", all notes derived from it should be in a flat hierarchy.
- Notes should be atomic units of knowledge. In books for example, we should have notes like "Concept X" instead of something like "Chapter 1". 
- Overview files should just contain important information about the folder, not actually any knowledge about the topic. (maybe rename to something else)
- todo tags should be actionable, in the sense that it should be connected to a task that can be done in a single sitting, don't use todo for tasks like "read this book".
