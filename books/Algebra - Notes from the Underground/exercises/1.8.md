Let n be a positive integer, and a & b be integers. prove that a and b have the same remainder when divided by n iff $a-b = nk$ for some k.

Proving that a, b having the same remainder implies $a-b=nk$:
$$a = qn + r$$
$$b = q'n + r$$
$$a-b = (q-q')n + r -r = (q-q')n=nk$$
Proving that $a-b = nk$ implies $a,b$ have the same remainder:
$$a=qn+r$$
$$b=q'n+r'$$
$$a-b=nk$$
$$qn+r-(q'n + r') = nk$$
$$(q-q')n +r -r' = nk$$
We know that $0 \leq r, r' < n \implies 0 \leq r-r' < n$ . Thus the only way for the equality to hold is to have $r-r' = 0 \iff r = r'$.
