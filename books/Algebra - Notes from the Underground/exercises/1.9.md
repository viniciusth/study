Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, what are the possible values of $gcd(n, n+2)$ and $gcd(n, n+6)$?

use the fact that $gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a\%b)$:
$$gcd(n, n+2)=gcd(n+2, n) = gcd(n, 2)$$
For $n \geq 2$, we have that $gcd(n, n+2) = 1$ if n is odd, otherwise $gcd(n, n+2) = 2$.
For $n=0$, $gcd(0, 2) = 2$
for $n=1$, $gcd(1, 3) = 1$
then for actually all $n \geq 0$ the odd/even rule works, I imagine the same thing works for the negative values.

for $gcd(n, n+6)$ we have a similar thing: $gcd(n, n+6) = gcd(n, 6)$ and thus the possible values are $1, 2, 3, 6$ which are the divisors of 6.
