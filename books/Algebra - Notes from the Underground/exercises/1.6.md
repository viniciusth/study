Prove that every cube of an integer must be of the form $9k$, $9k+1$, $9k+8$.

Simple case analysis with modulo:
Let $x = 9k + r$, then: $$x^3= (9k + r)^3 = 9^3k + 3(9k)^2r + 3\cdot 9kr^2 + r^3$$
$$=9(9^2+3\cdot 9k^2r + 3kr^2) + r^3$$
now we need to find $r'$ for $r^3 = 9k' + r'$. we know that $0 \leq r < 9$.
by doing calculations for all 9 values you will only reach 0, 1, 8.
0, 1, 2 => 0, 1, 8
3, 4, 5 => 1, 1, 8,
6, 7, 8 => 0, 1, 8
