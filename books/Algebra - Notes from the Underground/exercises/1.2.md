#### Statement
Prove that $|$ is an [[books/Algebra - Notes from the Underground/Order Relation|Order Relation]] for the set $\mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0}$.

##### Reflective
prove that $a \mid a$
$$a\mid a \iff a=ac \iff c=1$$
##### Transitive
prove that $a\mid b \land b\mid c \implies a \mid c$
$$a \mid b \iff b=ac_1$$
$$b \mid c \iff c = bc_2$$
$$a\mid c \iff c = ac_3$$
$$c = bc_2 = ac_1c_2=a(c_1c_2)=ac_3$$
##### Antisymmetric
prove that $a|b \land b|a \implies a=b$.
$$a\mid b \iff b=ac_1$$
$$b \mid a \iff a = bc_2$$
$$a =(b)c_2=a(c_1c_2) \iff c_1c_2=1 \iff c_1 = 1, c_2=1, a=b$$

It is not a total ordering, any prime pair will have $a \nmid b \land b \nmid a$ by definition.
It does not have a maximum element, by contradiction assume an integer $m$ to be the maximum element of the set, since there are infinite number of integers, $(m+1) \nmid m$ by definition.
