If a set $A$ has an equivalence relation $\sim$, then we can define the quotient of $A$ modulo $\sim$ as $A/\sim$.
The elements of this set are the equivalence classes of $A$ modulo $\sim$, and defined as
$$[a]_\sim = \{b \in A | b \sim a\}$$
The element $a$ is called a representative of the equivalence class $[a]_\sim$. 
If $a$ is a representative, then any $b$ element where $a \sim b$ is also a representative.
We then define
$$A/\sim = \{[a]_\sim | a \in A\}$$
An example would be the relation $\mod n$,  with $n=2$ for example we would have some of the following elements of $\mathbb{N}$ and their equivalence classes:
$[0]_\sim = \{0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots\}$, $0, 2, 4, \ldots$ are representatives of the equivalence class $[0]_\sim$
$[1]_\sim = \{1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots \}$, $1,3,5,\ldots$ are representatives of the equivalence class $[1]_\sim$

Equivalence relations and Partitions are different ways to encode the same type of information.
