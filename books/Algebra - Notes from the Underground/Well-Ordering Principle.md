A 'well-ordering' on a set $S$ is simply and order relation such that every nonempty subset of $S$ has a minimum over that relation.

- $\leq$ is a well-ordering on the set $\mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0}$ 
- $\leq$ is not a well-ordering on the set $\mathbb{Q}^{\geq 0}$
	- If you take a whole subset, assume a minimum value $q = \frac{n}{d}$, then there exists $q' = \frac{n}{d+1} < q$, which contradicts our statement.
