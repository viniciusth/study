For random things that I felt like saving but didn't have any specific context to take a full note on

- `Ethereum is a deterministic but practically unbounded state machine, consisting of a globally accessible singleton state and a virtual machine that applies changes to that state`
- `While the digital currency ether is both integral to and necessary for the operation of Ethereum, ether is intended as a _utility currency_ to pay for use of the Ethereum platform as the world computer.`
- `The msg object is one of the inputs that all contracts can access. It represents the transaction that triggered the execution of this contract. The attribute sender is the sender address of the transaction. The function transfer is a built-in function that transfers ether from the current contract to the address of the sender.`
- `a private key uniquely determines a single Ethereum address, also known as an _account_.`
