#### Chapter 1: Introduction
Goes over some topics mostly anyone with experience in using DBMS's knows implicitly.\
Didn't really enjoy reading since there wasn't much to learn, best part was index files & data files which starts getting into some more technical details.

Thinking more about it after a few days, I think just writing a ton of stuff may not be the most useful way to spend my time in learning these books.
For books like this one which doesn't have exercises I should probably just take notes of things that really stood out during reading, and create exercises if it fits.

Actually, it probably doesn't make sense to separate the notes into chapter hierarchies as folders, if I want to revisit a book, I'm not looking for specific chapters but concepts and knowledge that I gained, so I'll probably simplify the folder structure. It could be nice to have a small note with some takeaways from a chapter if needed.
