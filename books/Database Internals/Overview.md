#### Chapter 1: Introduction
Goes over some topics mostly anyone with experience in using DBMS's knows implicitly.\
Didn't really enjoy reading since there wasn't much to learn, best part was index files & data files which starts getting into some more technical details.

Thinking more about it after a few days, I think just writing a ton of stuff may not be the most useful way to spend my time in learning these books.
For books like this one which doesn't have exercises I should probably just take notes of things that really stood out during reading, and create exercises if it fits.
