Yes, there are a lot of books.
The idea is to study a little bit of whatever I feel like everyday, which means I can alternate between very different topics each day and even during the same day.


I think I need to figure out a rotation...
Everyday I should probably do atleast one math book - pick one between
- Algebra - Paolo Aluffi
- Linear Algebra Done Right
- Mathematics for Computer Science
do some reading, create notes, do exercises, anything you want for a block of time, then move on to one computer science topic, book, blog etc. and do the same thing for a block of time. Swapping the order should be fine as well.
After that, maybe just do what feels best -- math, CS or stopping.
